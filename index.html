        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Integrating heterogeneous data is crucial to elucidate the molecular bases of ovarian cancer. Measurements charting the relationship between genotype (e.g., transcriptomics), phenotype (e.g., imaging), and tumour microenvironment (e.g., metabolomics) are required for a full picture of tumour development. However, there is a lack of robust multimodal integration methods when only a limited number of common samples is available.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Epithelial ovarian cancers (EOCs) have the highest mortality rate among gynaecological cancers in the developed world. EOCs include a heterogeneous group of neoplasms, including serous, clear cell, endometrioid, and mucinous types. Serous ovarian carcinomas include two types: high-grade serous and low-grade cancers. According to Cancer Research UK, ovarian cancer affects about 7400 women annually, with over 60% presenting advanced-stage disease.
